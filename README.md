# Advent of Code 2021

These are my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/) challenge.

## Approach

I will be tackling the problems with [Go](https://go.dev/).  This is because I am working to improve my proficiency with the language.

## Questions and Observations

### Day 1

I have a couple of test cases that use the same test data.  How can I set this shared code up as a constant?

### Day 2

How can I implement dependency injection (DI)?  I want to be able to inject either version of sub into the script runner code.  

DONE.  Injected script runner function.
